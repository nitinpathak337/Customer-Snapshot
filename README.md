Hey Guys,

This is the Customer Snapshot app I have built using React, and Typescript.

Website live link: [https://customer-snapshot.onrender.com](https://customer-snapshot.onrender.com)

To start the application in local:

Clone the repo in your IDE, Run command 'npm i' to install the dependencies. Run command 'npm start' to start the application. Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app in the browser
